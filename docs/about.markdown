## Overview

Hello there, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Waridh Wongwandanee, but you can call me Bach. I am currently a Product Validation intern at Microchip and I
am working towards a Bachelors of Nanoscale System Design Computer Engineering
at the University of Alberta. In the first three years of my degree, I've been
mostly focused on software projects and skills, but we are now shifting towards
lower level system designs.
