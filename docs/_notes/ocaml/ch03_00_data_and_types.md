# Data and Types

Looking at the built in OCaml data types. The list of the types being covered are:

1. lists
2. variants
3. records
4. tuples
5. options
6. some others

- List and tuples are like Python and Rust.
- records and variants are like `struct` and `enum` from C, Java, and Rust.

These datatypes are called standard data types. There is also pattern matching, which is a feature that Rust also uses. This chapter will also teach us about OUnits. The thing with OUnits is that it relies on lists, so it was not discussed until now. Later in the chapter, we are going learn about more datatypes that are used by Rust like:

- **options**

Some other types that are covered includes:

- **association lists**, which is a simple implementation of maps based on lists and tuples.
- **algebraic data types**, which is the most important type in OCaml as other types are built on this one.
- **exceptions**, which are a special kind of an algebraic data type.
