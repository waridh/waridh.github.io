# Better Programming Through OCaml

Functional programming makes you let go of ideas that we have come to rely on. Assignment statements, loops, classes, and objects, among others.

## Learning topics

- The freedom of immutability
- Improved abstraction
- Type system -> Forcing correctness
- Some theory and implementation of programming languages.

The point of picking up OCaml is to experience a language that changes the way you think about programming.
