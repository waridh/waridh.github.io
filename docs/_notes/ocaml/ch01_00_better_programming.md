## Better Programming Through OCaml

Functional programming makes you let go of ideas that we have come to rely on. Assignment statements, loops, classes, and objects, among others. Instead, you will learn to use old and new tools in a new way. Recursion is approached in a more robust way, and pattern matching becomes second nature.

### Learning topics

- The freedom of immutability
- Improved abstraction
- Type system -> Forcing correctness
- Some theory and implementation of programming languages.

The point of picking up OCaml is to experience a language that changes the way you think about programming.
