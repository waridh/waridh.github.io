# Overview

Enums are used to define a type by enumerating it's possible variants.
- You can encode meaning with the data
- In rust, you can use the enum `Option`, which lets you identify if a value is something, or nothing.
- Rust pattern matching is also included in this.
- Finally, `if let` is a feature that allows you to handle enums in more ways.
