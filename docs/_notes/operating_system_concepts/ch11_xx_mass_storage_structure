## Overview

This chapter covers the basics of how HDD and SSDs work, along with how the operating system views and interface on a low level with these devices.

## Definitions

**HDD** - Hard Disk Drives

**SSD** - Solid State Drives

**NVM** - Non-volatile memory

## 11.1 Overview of Mass-Storage Structures

### Anatomy of Hard Disks

To understand why some queuing algorithms exist, you must first understand the anatomy of a hard disk. Here are some definitions:

**Spindle** - The center axle that the magnetic disks are resting on.

**Arm** - like a record player arm. It moves the Read-Write Head to the sector that the data it needs to read is stored.

**Read-Write Head** - the tip of the arm that is used to read the magnetic disks. Think of the head of a record player.

**Tracks** - Singular circumference on a single magnetic disk. These are what the data are stored on.

**Cylinder** - Since there are many magnetic disks stacked on a singular spindle, a cylinder that the tracks that are vertically overlapping.

**Sector** - A subdivision of a track. This is the smallest unit of transferable data on an HDD, and it usually ranges from 512B to 4KB.

### Problems with HDD

HDD are used because they have some of the best data to dollar ratio, while giving relatively good performance. One of the main issues with HDDs is that the head must find the sector that it is doing work on. This is mechanical movement, and it takes up the bulk of the latency of IO to an HDD.

To reduce latency, data are stored sequentially as it will also reduce the amount of times that the head must seek the right sector to do IO on.

The two delays caused by the mechanical nature of HDD are called:

**Seek time** - The time it takes for the head to get to the right track.

**Rotational latency** - The time it takes for the right sector to rotate to the head.

Some HDDs will have flash memory that will act as a cache for better performance.

Usually, the head will glide just above the magnetic disk, with a clearance in the microns. By design, if the head makes physical contact with the magnetic disk, it would cause the HDD to fail. This event is called a **head crash**, and it normally cannot be repaired.

### Non-Volatile Memory

Solid state devices. NVM devices do not have mechanical parts and instead rely on NAND flash and a controller to store data. The advantage with these devices is that they do not have mechanical seek time, or rotational latency. There are still drawbacks to using NVM in that they are more expensive per MB, and that a single page on the NVM have a limited read and write cycles before it deteriorates.

#### NAND Flash Characteristics

NAND flash can be read and written on page increments, but data cannot be directly overwritten. Instead, data must be erased before they can be written to again. Due to this extra constraint, the following system has been designed:

- There is now an extra grouping layer that has been implemented called blocks, which is a collection of pages.
- When a page is getting updated, that updated page is written to a new page, and the old page is marked as invalid. This means that it will not be read.
- When a block of invalid page has formed, the NAND controller will erase this block.
- The flash translation layer is used by the controller to keep track of which pages are good, and which are invalid data.

There are some extra cases that are designed for when the NAND flash still has some storage remaining, but there is no invalid block to erase. This case handling is called **Garbage Collection** and it requires that the manufacturer allocate around 20% extra storage to the NAND flash device, which is called **over-provisioning**. To reiterate the problem, NAND flash devices cannot write new data to a page that already has data, so the pre-existing data must be erased before it can be written to. In this scenario where there isn't a fully invalid block that can be erased, garbage collection will copy the block into the **Over-provisioned** area, so that the controller will know what was in the block prior. The controller then erases the original block, and write the updated version with both the new data and the old valid data into that block.

Here are some notes about operation speed:

**Read** - The fastest operation on a NAND flash device.

**Write** - Slower than read, but still relatively fast.

**Erase** - The slowest operation.
