# Latches and Flip-Flops

Bistable elements are needed when trying to build components from the fundamental level. Flip-flips and latches hold these places. Let's do a little review on them.

Quick definition: When an output of an element goes into the input of another and vice versa, they are defined as *cross-coupled*.

*Bistable* is when a circuit has two stable states. Once you start building up more complex systems, there are going to be N stable states, which can convey $\log_2N$ bits of information.

## 3.2.1 SR Latch

Very simple sequential circuit, an SR latch is two cross-coupled NOR gates.

Functionally, it uses the set and reset signal to control the outputs of both $Q$ and $\bar{Q}$. Here is a little truth table for it:

| S   | R   | Q   | $\bar{Q}$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --------- |
| 0   | 0   | Q   | $\bar{Q}$ | 
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1         |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0         |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 0         |

I have done a circuit design course before doing this, so I have an idea of how it is done. Just remember that there are hold, set, reset, and the unideal output of both Q and $\bar{Q}$ being 0.

## 3.2.2 D Latch

To improve upon the SR latch, and simplify the interface, we now have the D flip flop, which controls what it should change to, and how it should change. This is done by binding the S and R input with a new input D with an intermediate of $\bar{D}$. The clk signal was also added to control when the state should change.

Simpler to have a little example in the form of a truth table:

| CLK | D   | Q   | $\bar{Q}$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --------- |
| 0   | X   | Q   | $\bar{Q}$ |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1         |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0         |

## 3.2.3 D Flip-Flop

So what makes a flip flop different? First of all a d flip-flop is made from two back to back latches, and functionally, it was designed to improve synchronization and reduce erratic behaviour by allowing state changes to occur during some edge of the clock signal.
