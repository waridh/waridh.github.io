# LaTeX

## Preface

LaTex is a strong writing tool that is often used in academics for it's ability
to let you focus on content, and create beautiful math equations. As that is
where my future is, I will focus on it.

## Overview

LaTeX is a language that lets the author focus solely on the content that they
want to create, and let design be looked at later. It has a variable system that
lets you assign author, title, etc to it.

### Features

- Typesetting journal articles, technical reports, books, and other math stuff.
- Control over large document containing cross-references, sectioning, tables and
figures.
- Typesetting of complex mathematical formulas
- Advanced typesetting of mathematics with AMS-LaTeX
- Automatic bibliography and indexes
- Multi-lingual typesetting

## Other notes

- Have a look at Zathura for linux when you get the chance, it's supposed to be
a strong document viewer.
