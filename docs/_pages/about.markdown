## Overview

Hello, you've stumbled upon my about me page. I'm an upcoming IP System Engineering Co-op at AMD. Previously, I have worked as a Product Validation intern at Microchip and a research assistant working with point cloud data processing. My degree says Nanoscale System Design Computer Engineer, but I would say that I am just a Computer Engineer.

**Fun note:** I kinda know OCaml.
