This is a testing page used to confirm my knowledge of how to create a new page
on jekyll. I think that I have a confident understanding of it now, so I will
use it in the future to blog and describe my project progression? Or maybe I
could just make pages for each bits of projects and then update it as I make
changes it it? It actually seems kinda simple.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
