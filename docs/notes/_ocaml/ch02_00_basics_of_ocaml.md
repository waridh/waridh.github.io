# The Basics of OCaml

There are five essential components to learning a new language

## 1. Syntax

The rules that define what constitute a textually well-formed program. This includes keywords, restrictions on whitespace, formatting punctuation, operators, etc.

## 2. Semantics

Rules that define the behaviour of a program. It's about the meaning of the program. There are two pieces of semantics: dynamic and static.

### Dynamic Semantics

Run-time behaviour of the program as it is executed or evaluated. Compile time checking makes sure that the program is legal, beyond any syntactic requirements.

### Static Semantics

The most important kind is probably *type checking*. Rules that define whether a program is well typed or not. Semantics are usually harder than syntax to learn.

## 3. Idioms

The common approaches to using language features to express computation.

## 4. Libraries

Pre-written codes. Use the operating systems definition. Less writing, means more time saved.

## 5. Tools

Other than just the compiler and the interpreter, you also have access to debuggers, IDEs and analysis tools for things like performance, memory usage, and correctness.
