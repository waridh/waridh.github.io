# Introduction to Bipolar Transistors

## What are Transistors

Transistors are the most important active component of a circuit. It is used in most modern circuits, and make up the complexities of processors and ICs. Transistors are able to amplify and act as switches.

**There are two major types of transistors**:
1. Bipolar Junction Transistors - (*BJTs*)
2. Field-Effect Transistors - (*FETs*)

### Rough Comparison between BJTs and FETs

| BJTs | FETs |
| --- | --- |
| Excels in accuracy low noise | Low power, high impedance, and high current switching |

This is just a basic rundown of the difference, it gets much more complicated than this.


This chapter focuses on BJTs and it will teach how transistors work in a simple model, and built itself up from there. Ebers-Moll convention will be looked at next with a simple three terminal model. This model will be independent of poorly controlled transistor parameters like current gain.

### Transistor Convention

Voltage at a transistor terminal (relative to ground) is indicated by a single subscript (C, B, or E): $V_{C}$ is collector voltage.

Voltage between two terminal is indicated with a double subscript, for example: $V_{BE}$ is the base to emitter voltage drop.

When the same subscript letter is repeated, that is the power supply voltage. Something familiar would be $V_{CC}$, which is the positive power supply associated with the collector and $V_{EE}$ is the negative power supply associated with the emitter.

### Difficulties

Transistors are a bit harder to learn the first time because they are three terminal and there are two voltages and two current to juggle.
